# Linkwise

**Linkwise** is a lightweight, privacy-first web app that turns any URL into a clear, concise summary. It extracts the most readable content from a webpage and uses a **local Ollama LLM** to generate high-quality summaries—no cloud APIs, no data leaving your machine.

Built for speed, simplicity, and control.

## Why Linkwise?

The web is noisy. Linkwise strips away the clutter and delivers the essence.

- **Local-first AI** – Summarization runs entirely on your machine via Ollama.
- **Smart content extraction** – Pulls readable text from semantic containers like `article`, `main`, and `body`.
- **Minimal, fast UI** – Paste a link, get a summary.
- **Prompt-efficient** – Input is trimmed automatically to keep responses focused and fast.
